# Udacity MLND Deep Learning Capstone  

## Transfer Learning for Multi-Class Fish Classification  

This project leverages **transfer learning** with the **VGG16** neural network architecture to classify multiple fish species. The dataset is sourced from the [Nature Conservancy Fishery Monitoring](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring) competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).  

The final model achieves a **log-loss of 1.19**, placing in the **top 45%** of the leaderboard.  

For a detailed analysis, including model architecture, visualizations, and validation results, refer to the final report:

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to develop an efficient **deep learning model** for fish classification using transfer learning techniques. The **VGG16** architecture is fine-tuned on the dataset to improve classification accuracy.  

### Key Features:  
- **Transfer Learning with VGG16**: Pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for fish classification.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Train-validation split for better generalization.  
- **Model Visualization**: Includes diagrams and performance metrics.  
- **Reproducible Workflow**: Jupyter notebooks and scripts for easy replication.
